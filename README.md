# Code Refactor Starter Code

Description: 
    Given a starter code, this code was edited and rearranged in order to make it more accessible. This is accomplished by:
    1. Adding alt attributes to images where needed for screen readers.
    2. Making the elements of the HTML code more "semantic", or more specific, rather than 'div soup'. 
    3. Tidying up the HTML code to make it more readable and neat for future coding. 
    4. Ensuring the head elements are in sequential order. 
    5. Giving the webpage an apt title.
